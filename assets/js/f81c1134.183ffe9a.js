In return, keystone will issue a token that\\nentitles you to have certain privileges when talking to the individual services.\\n\\nOne of the supported ways to authenticate is to use oauth2 tokens.\\nWhen keystonemiddleware investigates these\\ntokens it adds headers that indicate privileges associated with the account.\\n\\nUnfortunately, keystonemiddleware does not clear headers when receiving\\noauth2 tokens, so an authenticated user can send oauth2 tokens with\\nheaders that actually indicate admin privileges and can trick services\\ninto assuming elevated privileges.\\nThe issue was introduced with keystonemiddleware 10.5.0 when support for\\n`external_oauth2_tokens` was added.\\n\\nThe vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2026-22797](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22797).\\n\\nThe issue was reported by Grzegorz Grasza of RedHat.\\n\\n## Impact on OpenStack deployments\\n\\nWhen keystone is configured to accept oauth2 tokens for authentication, anyone\\nable to produce and send any valid tokens may inject headers to impersonate other\\nusers or assume additional roles up to and including admin privileges. Admin\\nprivileges allow unrestricted access via the API and are only meant to be used\\nby the cloud operators.\\n\\n_To abuse this vulnerability, the attacker must be an authenticated\\nuser of the platform. In addition, the platform must be configured to\\naccept oauth2 tokens, which is not a supported configuration in yaook\\nnor a simple change versus the default configuration is OSISM._\\n\\nTo make services accept oauth2 tokens, their config would need\\nto be changed via `paste.ini`\\n\\n```ini\\n[pipeline:main]\\npipeline = ext_oauth2_token\\n\\n[filter:ext_oauth2_token]\\npaste.filter_factory = keystonemiddleware.external_oauth2_token:filter_factory\\n```\\n\\nin order to be affected. This is not the case in any default configurations and\\nalso not when using the OIDC federation with keycloak that is documented for SCS.\\n\\nProviders are advised to investigate whether they have done changes to enable oauth2\\ntokens via keystonemiddleware as depicted above and assume that they are affected\\nin that case.\\n\\n## Embargo\\n\\nThe issue has been reported to the OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team in\\nprivate. The reporters and upstream developers have worked together to address\\nthe issue with fixes and an embargo date has been set to Thursday, 2026-01-15,\\n15:00 UTC (16:00 CET). At this point in\\ntime, the patches get merged and the OpenStack Security Advisory\\n([OSSA-2026-001](https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2026-001.html))\\nis published. The issue is tracked in OpenStack issue\\n[#2219018](https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystonemiddleware/+bug/2129018), which should become\\npublically accessible after the lift of the embargo and the publication\\nof this advisory.\\n\\nUnder the used responsible disclosure approach, the information was shared with\\na select group of trustable users of OpenStack, so they can prepare updates and\\nprotect their infrastructure at the time this issue becomes public.\\n\\n## Mitigation and Fixes\\n\\nThe fix is straightforward and consists of clearing headers and explicitly\\nunsetting the critical headers. For affected setups, it is recommended to update\\nthe keystone services immediately.\\n\\nFor clouds that can not update keystone directly, the dangerous headers could\\nbe filtered out by a reverse proxy or similar network infrastructure in front\\nof the openstack API services or the oauth2 tokens could be temporarily disabled\\nby reverting back to the standard\\n\\n```ini\\n[filter:authtoken]\\npaste.filter_factory = keystonemiddleware.auth_token:filter_factory\\n```\\n\\n### Links to specific information from related OpenStack distributions\\n\\n- [ALASCA](https://alasca.cloud/) has issued an\\n  [advisory for yaook](https://lists.alasca.cloud/hyperkitty/list/yaook@lists.alasca.cloud/thread/Q2GZ7PNXHJ7YHRDALKXTHZMTHS7PM5NE/)\\n  basically stating that it\'s not really possible to use yaook in a way that it would be affected.\\n- [OSISM](https://osism.tech/) has published an\\n  [advisary for OSISM](https://osism.tech/docs/appendix/security/ossa-2026-001/)\\n  with more details how to get a fixed keystone container deployed in case you\\n  have manually enabled such oauth2 tokens.\\n\\n## Thanks\\n\\nThe authors would like to thank Grzegorz Grasza, Thomas Goirand (zigo),\\nJay Faulkner, David Wilde, Artem Goncharov and Jeremy Stanley for their\\nwork on this issue.\\n\\n## Sovereign Cloud Stack Security Contact\\n\\nSCS security contact is [security@scs.community](mailto:security@scs.community), as published on\\n[https://scs.community/.well-known/security.txt](https://scs.community/.well-known/security.txt).\\n\\n## Version history\\n\\n- Initial Draft, v0.1, 2026-01-13, 22:30 CET.\\n- Release, v1.0, 2026-01-20, 08:30 CET.\\n- Release to SCS docs blog, v1.1, 2026-01-23, 10:30 CET."},{"id":"introducing_new_blog","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/introducing_new_blog","editUrl":"https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs/edit/main/blog/2026-01-22-introducing-docs-blog.md","source":"@site/blog/2026-01-22-introducing-docs-blog.md","title":"Introducing A New Blog Site On Our Docs Page","description":"Evolution of SCS activities","date":"2026-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/blog/tags/docusaurus"},{"inline":true,"label":"scs","permalink":"/blog/tags/scs"},{"inline":true,"label":"community","permalink":"/blog/tags/community"},{"inline":true,"label":"blog","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog"}],"readingTime":2.08,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Kurt Garloff","title":"CEO @ S7n Cloud Services, former CTO @ SCS","url":"https://github.com/garloff","imageURL":"https://github.com/garloff.png","key":"garloff","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"introducing_new_blog","title":"Introducing A New Blog Site On Our Docs Page","authors":["garloff"],"tags":["docusaurus","scs","community","blog"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"CVE-2026-22797 OpenStack privilege escalation with oauth2 tokens","permalink":"/blog/openstack_oauth2_privescalation_cve_2026_22797"}},"content":"## Evolution of SCS activities\\n\\nPreviously, we had a project web site that covered many\\nareas of work that was done in the SCS project until it was successfully completed\\nat the end of 2024. It covered the standardization work as well as the development\\nof the reference implementation and also had a vast collection of links and technical\\ncontent, a lot of which was related to the reference implementation. For newcomers,\\nit was somewhat hard to distill the various aspects and goals of SCS though.\\n\\nWith the end of the funded project, we split the activities into different organizations\\nwith distinct goals:\\n\\n1. The [Forum SCS Standards](https://sovereigncloudstack.org/en/about-scs/network/) is\\n   responsible for governing the standardization process. While it pulls significant input\\n   from the various software projects that belong to the SCS ecosystem, it is neutral towards\\n   them beyond the preference for standards compliance. This reflects that there can and\\n   ideally should be several implementations for a standard.\\n   The [new website](https://sovereigncloudstack.org/) serves as an overall entrance point to\\n   Sovereign Cloud Stack with a focus on the standardization and certification.\\n2. The SCS community consists of individuals and organizations that develop, support,\\n   test, use, or otherwise contribute to the software and standards that implement and\\n   codify SCS. The community elects a [project board](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0005-v2-project-governance)\\n   that organizes and motivates contributions. The work of the community is mainly visible\\n   on the [Documentation web site](https://docs.scs.community) and the\\n   [github site](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/).\\n\\n## Blog articles\\n\\nBlog articles with technical content relating to a specific implementation (or a set\\nof implementations) are not a great fit for Forum\'s web site.\\nThe good news is that the SCS project\'s rich\\n[Documentation site](https://docs.scs.community/) is architected in a way that\\nit assembles documentation from various places. Unlike the Forum, it does not need\\nto prioritize neutrality as top priority, but benefits and prefers those projects\\nthat contribute useful content to it.\\n\\nWe have decided to use docusaurus\' blog feature to publish blog articles\\n[here](https://docs.scs.community/blog/). We appreciate contributions.\\n\\n## Old blog content\\n\\nThe blog content from the old web site has been migrated over into the\\n[archive on the new site](https://sovereigncloudstack.org/en/community_blog/). You\\ncan also find the other types of community news [there](https://sovereigncloudstack.org/en/community-news/).\\n\\nSome news that might fit the Blog category have also been published in the\\n[main news section](https://sovereigncloudstack.org/en/insights/news/) on the new web site."}]}}')}}]);
