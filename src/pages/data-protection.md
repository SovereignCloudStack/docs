# Data Protection Statement

This website uses log files to identify problems with the site and to monitor traffic. The log files contain traces of which pages have been accessed when from which IP address. The raw log files are kept for a week and are then deleted.

The raw log files are not shared with anyone; however within the first week, we have access to the log files to solve technical problems. In exceptional cases stripped down copies of the log files may be stored for longer to analyze problems spanning more than a week. These copies are deleted as soon as the problem has been solved.

In order to make SCS more accessible we use a prompt on the index page which is powered by [markprompt](https://github.com/motifland/markprompt) by [Motif](https://motif.land/). Markprompt is soley trained on our documentation content to give better access to SCS.

OpenAI keeps training data for 30 days. Read more: [OpenAI API data usage policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies).
