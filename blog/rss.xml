<p>This advisory was drafted a few days ago, before the issue was public.
As the issue turned out to only affect very specific configurations (which are
not used in any standard SCS setting), we did not publish it with the urgency
that we normally apply to protect our partners in time for a vulnerability becoming
public.</p>
<p>Instead, we have taken the time to sort out the publication place in the the new Docs
blog space, as described by the previous blog post.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-vulnerability">The vulnerability<a href="https://docs.scs.community/blog/openstack_oauth2_privescalation_cve_2026_22797#the-vulnerability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The vulnerability" title="Direct link to The vulnerability" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Keystone is the central Identity and Access Management component in OpenStack.
Whenever you talk to an OpenStack service, you authenticate to keystone via
one of the supported methods. In return, keystone will issue a token that
entitles you to have certain privileges when talking to the individual services.</p>
<p>One of the supported ways to authenticate is to use oauth2 tokens.
When keystonemiddleware investigates these
tokens it adds headers that indicate privileges associated with the account.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, keystonemiddleware does not clear headers when receiving
oauth2 tokens, so an authenticated user can send oauth2 tokens with
headers that actually indicate admin privileges and can trick services
into assuming elevated privileges.
The issue was introduced with keystonemiddleware 10.5.0 when support for
<code>external_oauth2_tokens</code> was added.</p>
<p>The vulnerability has been assigned <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22797" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">CVE-2026-22797</a>.</p>
<p>The issue was reported by Grzegorz Grasza of RedHat.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="impact-on-openstack-deployments">Impact on OpenStack deployments<a href="https://docs.scs.community/blog/openstack_oauth2_privescalation_cve_2026_22797#impact-on-openstack-deployments" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Impact on OpenStack deployments" title="Direct link to Impact on OpenStack deployments" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>When keystone is configured to accept oauth2 tokens for authentication, anyone
able to produce and send any valid tokens may inject headers to impersonate other
users or assume additional roles up to and including admin privileges. Admin
privileges allow unrestricted access via the API and are only meant to be used
by the cloud operators.</p>
<p><em>To abuse this vulnerability, the attacker must be an authenticated
user of the platform. In addition, the platform must be configured to
accept oauth2 tokens, which is not a supported configuration in yaook
nor a simple change versus the default configuration is OSISM.</em></p>
<p>To make services accept oauth2 tokens, their config would need
to be changed via <code>paste.ini</code></p>
<div class="language-ini codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-ini codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">[pipeline:main]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">pipeline = ext_oauth2_token</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">[filter:ext_oauth2_token]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">paste.filter_factory = keystonemiddleware.external_oauth2_token:filter_factory</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>in order to be affected. This is not the case in any default configurations and
also not when using the OIDC federation with keycloak that is documented for SCS.</p>
<p>Providers are advised to investigate whether they have done changes to enable oauth2
tokens via keystonemiddleware as depicted above and assume that they are affected
in that case.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="embargo">Embargo<a href="https://docs.scs.community/blog/openstack_oauth2_privescalation_cve_2026_22797#embargo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Embargo" title="Direct link to Embargo" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The issue has been reported to the OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team in
private. The reporters and upstream developers have worked together to address
the issue with fixes and an embargo date has been set to Thursday, 2026-01-15,
15:00 UTC (16:00 CET). At this point in
time, the patches get merged and the OpenStack Security Advisory
(<a href="https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2026-001.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">OSSA-2026-001</a>)
is published. The issue is tracked in OpenStack issue
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystonemiddleware/+bug/2129018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">#2219018</a>, which should become
publically accessible after the lift of the embargo and the publication
of this advisory.</p>
<p>Under the used responsible disclosure approach, the information was shared with
a select group of trustable users of OpenStack, so they can prepare updates and
protect their infrastructure at the time this issue becomes public.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="mitigation-and-fixes">Mitigation and Fixes<a href="https://docs.scs.community/blog/openstack_oauth2_privescalation_cve_2026_22797#mitigation-and-fixes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Mitigation and Fixes" title="Direct link to Mitigation and Fixes" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The fix is straightforward and consists of clearing headers and explicitly
unsetting the critical headers. For affected setups, it is recommended to update
the keystone services immediately.</p>
<p>For clouds that can not update keystone directly, the dangerous headers could
be filtered out by a reverse proxy or similar network infrastructure in front
of the openstack API services or the oauth2 tokens could be temporarily disabled
by reverting back to the standard</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="evolution-of-scs-activities">Evolution of SCS activities<a href="https://docs.scs.community/blog/introducing_new_blog#evolution-of-scs-activities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Evolution of SCS activities" title="Direct link to Evolution of SCS activities" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Previously, we had a project web site that covered many
areas of work that was done in the SCS project until it was successfully completed
at the end of 2024. It covered the standardization work as well as the development
of the reference implementation and also had a vast collection of links and technical
content, a lot of which was related to the reference implementation. For newcomers,
it was somewhat hard to distill the various aspects and goals of SCS though.</p>
<p>With the end of the funded project, we split the activities into different organizations
with distinct goals:</p>
<ol>
<li class="">The <a href="https://sovereigncloudstack.org/en/about-scs/network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Forum SCS Standards</a> is
responsible for governing the standardization process. While it pulls significant input
from the various software projects that belong to the SCS ecosystem, it is neutral towards
them beyond the preference for standards compliance. This reflects that there can and
ideally should be several implementations for a standard.
The <a href="https://sovereigncloudstack.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">new website</a> serves as an overall entrance point to
Sovereign Cloud Stack with a focus on the standardization and certification.</li>
<li class="">The SCS community consists of individuals and organizations that develop, support,
test, use, or otherwise contribute to the software and standards that implement and
codify SCS. The community elects a <a href="https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0005-v2-project-governance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">project board</a>
that organizes and motivates contributions. The work of the community is mainly visible
on the <a href="https://docs.scs.community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Documentation web site</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">github site</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="blog-articles">Blog articles<a href="https://docs.scs.community/blog/introducing_new_blog#blog-articles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Blog articles" title="Direct link to Blog articles" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Blog articles with technical content relating to a specific implementation (or a set
of implementations) are not a great fit for Forum's web site.
The good news is that the SCS project's rich
<a href="https://docs.scs.community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Documentation site</a> is architected in a way that
it assembles documentation from various places. Unlike the Forum, it does not need
to prioritize neutrality as top priority, but benefits and prefers those projects
that contribute useful content to it.</p>
<p>We have decided to use docusaurus' blog feature to publish blog articles
<a href="https://docs.scs.community/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">here</a>. We appreciate contributions.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="old-blog-content">Old blog content<a href="https://docs.scs.community/blog/introducing_new_blog#old-blog-content" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Old blog content" title="Direct link to Old blog content" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The blog content from the old web site has been migrated over into the
<a href="https://sovereigncloudstack.org/en/community_blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">archive on the new site</a>. You
can also find the other types of community news <a href="https://sovereigncloudstack.org/en/community-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">there</a>.</p>
<p>Some news that might fit the Blog category have also been published in the
<a href="https://sovereigncloudstack.org/en/insights/news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">main news section</a> on the new web site.</p>]]></content:encoded>
