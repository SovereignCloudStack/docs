In return, keystone will issue a token that\nentitles you to have certain privileges when talking to the individual services.</p>\n<p>One of the supported ways to authenticate is to use oauth2 tokens.\nWhen keystonemiddleware investigates these\ntokens it adds headers that indicate privileges associated with the account.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, keystonemiddleware does not clear headers when receiving\noauth2 tokens, so an authenticated user can send oauth2 tokens with\nheaders that actually indicate admin privileges and can trick services\ninto assuming elevated privileges.\nThe issue was introduced with keystonemiddleware 10.5.0 when support for\n<code>external_oauth2_tokens</code> was added.</p>\n<p>The vulnerability has been assigned <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22797\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">CVE-2026-22797</a>.</p>\n<p>The issue was reported by Grzegorz Grasza of RedHat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"impact-on-openstack-deployments\">Impact on OpenStack deployments<a href=\"https://docs.scs.community/blog/openstack_oauth2_privescalation_cve_2026_22797#impact-on-openstack-deployments\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Impact on OpenStack deployments\" title=\"Direct link to Impact on OpenStack deployments\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h2>\n<p>When keystone is configured to accept oauth2 tokens for authentication, anyone\nable to produce and send any valid tokens may inject headers to impersonate other\nusers or assume additional roles up to and including admin privileges. Admin\nprivileges allow unrestricted access via the API and are only meant to be used\nby the cloud operators.</p>\n<p><em>To abuse this vulnerability, the attacker must be an authenticated\nuser of the platform. In addition, the platform must be configured to\naccept oauth2 tokens, which is not a supported configuration in yaook\nnor a simple change versus the default configuration is OSISM.</em></p>\n<p>To make services accept oauth2 tokens, their config would need\nto be changed via <code>paste.ini</code></p>\n<div class=\"language-ini codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block\" style=\"--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36\"><div class=\"codeBlockContent_QJqH\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"prism-code language-ini codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar\" style=\"color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36\"><code class=\"codeBlockLines_e6Vv\"><span class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#F8F8F2\"><span class=\"token plain\">[pipeline:main]</span><br></span><span class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#F8F8F2\"><span class=\"token plain\">pipeline = ext_oauth2_token</span><br></span><span class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#F8F8F2\"><span class=\"token plain\" style=\"display:inline-block\"></span><br></span><span class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#F8F8F2\"><span class=\"token plain\">[filter:ext_oauth2_token]</span><br></span><span class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#F8F8F2\"><span class=\"token plain\">paste.filter_factory = keystonemiddleware.external_oauth2_token:filter_factory</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>\n<p>in order to be affected. This is not the case in any default configurations and\nalso not when using the OIDC federation with keycloak that is documented for SCS.</p>\n<p>Providers are advised to investigate whether they have done changes to enable oauth2\ntokens via keystonemiddleware as depicted above and assume that they are affected\nin that case.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"embargo\">Embargo<a href=\"https://docs.scs.community/blog/openstack_oauth2_privescalation_cve_2026_22797#embargo\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Embargo\" title=\"Direct link to Embargo\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h2>\n<p>The issue has been reported to the OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team in\nprivate. The reporters and upstream developers have worked together to address\nthe issue with fixes and an embargo date has been set to Thursday, 2026-01-15,\n15:00 UTC (16:00 CET).

It covered the standardization work as well as the development\nof the reference implementation and also had a vast collection of links and technical\ncontent, a lot of which was related to the reference implementation. For newcomers,\nit was somewhat hard to distill the various aspects and goals of SCS though.</p>\n<p>With the end of the funded project, we split the activities into different organizations\nwith distinct goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"\">The <a href=\"https://sovereigncloudstack.org/en/about-scs/network/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">Forum SCS Standards</a> is\nresponsible for governing the standardization process. While it pulls significant input\nfrom the various software projects that belong to the SCS ecosystem, it is neutral towards\nthem beyond the preference for standards compliance. This reflects that there can and\nideally should be several implementations for a standard.\nThe <a href=\"https://sovereigncloudstack.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">new website</a> serves as an overall entrance point to\nSovereign Cloud Stack with a focus on the standardization and certification.</li>\n<li class=\"\">The SCS community consists of individuals and organizations that develop, support,\ntest, use, or otherwise contribute to the software and standards that implement and\ncodify SCS. The community elects a <a href=\"https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0005-v2-project-governance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">project board</a>\nthat organizes and motivates contributions. The work of the community is mainly visible\non the <a href=\"https://docs.scs.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">Documentation web site</a> and the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">github site</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"blog-articles\">Blog articles<a href=\"https://docs.scs.community/blog/introducing_new_blog#blog-articles\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Blog articles\" title=\"Direct link to Blog articles\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h2>\n<p>Blog articles with technical content relating to a specific implementation (or a set\nof implementations) are not a great fit for Forum's web site.\nThe good news is that the SCS project's rich\n<a href=\"https://docs.scs.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">Documentation site</a> is architected in a way that\nit assembles documentation from various places. Unlike the Forum, it does not need\nto prioritize neutrality as top priority, but benefits and prefers those projects\nthat contribute useful content to it.</p>\n<p>We have decided to use docusaurus' blog feature to publish blog articles\n<a href=\"https://docs.scs.community/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">here</a>.
