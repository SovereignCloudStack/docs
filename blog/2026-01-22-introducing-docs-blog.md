## Evolution of SCS activities

Previously, we had [a project web site](https://scs.community/) that covered many
areas of work that was done in the SCS project until it was successfully completed
at the end of 2024. It covered the standardization work as well as the development
of the reference implementation and also had a vast collection of links and technical
content, a lot of which was related to the reference implementation. For newcomers,
it was somewhat hard to distill the various aspects and goals of SCS though.

With the end of the funded project, we split the activities into different organizations
with distinct goals:

1. The [Forum SCS Standards](https://sovereigncloudstack.org/en/about-scs/network/) is
   responsible for governing the standardization process. While it pulls significant input
   from the various software projects that belong to the SCS ecosystem, it is neutral towards
   them beyond the preference for standards compliance. This reflects that there can and
   ideally should be several implementations for a standard.
   The [new website](https://sovereigncloudstack.org/) serves as an overall entrance point to Sovereign Cloud Stack with a focus on the standardization and certification.
2. The SCS community consists of individuals and organizations that develop, support,
   test, use, or otherwise contribute to the software and standards that implement and
   codify SCS. The community elects a [project board](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0005-v2-project-governance)
   that organizes and motivates contributions. The work of the community is mainly visible
   on the [Documentation web site](https://docs.scs.community) and the
   [github site](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/).

## Blog articles

Blog articles with technical content relating to a specific implementation (or a set
of implementations) are not a great fit for Forum's web site.
The good news is that the SCS project's rich
[Documentation site](https://docs.scs.community/) is architected in a way that
it assembles documentation from various places. Unlike the Forum, it does not need
to prioritize neutrality as top priority, but benefits and prefers those projects
that contribute useful content to it.

We have decided to use docusaurus' blog feature to publish blog articles
[here](https://docs.scs.community/blog/). We appreciat contributions.

## Old blog content

The blog content from the old web site has been migrated over into the
[archive on the new site](https://sovereigncloudstack.org/en/community_blog/). You
can also find the other types of community news [there](https://sovereigncloudstack.org/en/community-news/).

Some news that might fit the Blog category have also been published in the
[main news section](https://sovereigncloudstack.org/en/insights/news/) on the new page.
