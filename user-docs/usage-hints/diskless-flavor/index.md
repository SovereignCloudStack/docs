## Purpose

Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) downgraded the formerly mandatory flavors with
root disks to recommended ones when the flavor naming standard version 3
became effective in the fall 2023. For many users using flavors that comprise
a root disk is still the standard and at least when using CLI tooling,
it's also simpler.

This article documents how the diskless flavors can be used with common
IaC tooling.
