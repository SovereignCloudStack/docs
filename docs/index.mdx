## About

The Sovereign Cloud Stack combines the best of Cloud Computing in one unified standard.
SCS is built, backed, and operated by an active open-source community worldwide.

## Architectural Overview

## Use Cases and Deployment Examples

### Virtualization (IaaS) Layer

The SCS IaaS Reference Implementation is based on [OSISM](https://osism.tech/).

#### Quick Start with Cloud-in-a-Box

You can do a single node installation for learning, testing or development purposes.
The Cloud-in-a-Box configuration was built explicitly for this scenario.
Check it out [here](/docs/iaas/deployment-examples/cloud-in-a-box)
It comes with a complete set of services, even Ceph is part of it
(despite of course not offering much redundancy on a single-node).

#### Reference Implementation Testbed

The fastest way to get in touch with SCS is to deploy a SCS cloud virtually.

This means that you set up an SCS test installation including all the infrastructure
pieces such as database, message queueing, ceph, monitoring and logging, IAM, the
[OpenStack](https://openstack.org/) core services, and (soon) the Container layer
on top of an existing OpenStack IaaS platform, ideally one that allows for nested
virtualization.

Read the [testbed docs](/docs/iaas/deployment-examples/testbed) to learn how to get the
testbed running. Please read carefully through the
[deployment](/docs/iaas/deployment-examples/testbed#deployment) section of the
manual.

#### Examples for real deployments

[artcodix](https://artcodix.com/) has [shared](/docs/iaas/deployment-examples/artcodix/)
some details on their production setup. The SCS team itself has created [extensive
documentation](/docs/turnkey-solution/hardware-landscape/) including details on the
used hardware.

### Container Layer

The Reference Implementation (v2) for the container (Kubernetes-as-a-Service = KaaS) layer
is provided by [Cluster Stacks](/docs/category/cluster-stacks)
from [syself](https://syself.com/).

#### Cluster Stacks

With the Cluster Stacks, in the V2 KaaS reference implementation, we provide an opinionated optimized configuration of Kubernetes cluster management based on [Kubernetes Cluster-API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/).
Through better packaging, integrated testing, and bundled configuration, SCS-based Kubernetes clusters provide easier individualization.
Throughout the R6 development cycle Cluster Stacks were taken from a technical preview to be [functional and available on top of the IaaS reference implementation](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/milestone/8) as well to replace the V1 KaaS reference implementation [k8s-cluster-api-provider](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/).
The Cluster Stacks have fully replaced V1 meanwhile to be the production-grade KaaS solution in SCS, please check out the
[Quick Start Guide](/docs/container/components/cluster-stacks/providers/openstack/quickstart).
For demo, test and development purposes, you can also try the [demo](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks-demo) repository which is an implementation using the (not-for-production) Docker provider. Implementations for other infrastructure are intended; the one for Hetzner for example is maintained by syself itself.

### Public SCS Clouds in production

Find the current list of scs compatible clouds [here](https://docs.scs.community/standards/certification/overview#compliant-cloud-environments).

### Development of SCS

While the SCS project tracks the efforts across the released epics and user stories, the work on the code, whenever possible, happens upstream. As such, these repositories are usually not found in the SCS GitHub organization. SCS works directly in the following upstream projects:

- CNCF projects,
- OpenStack,
- kolla-ansible,
- OSISM and others.

All code not pushed upstream can be found in the [SCS Github organization](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack).

### Issues and Bugs

If you can identify the affected component, raise the issue against the relevant repository in the SovereignCloudStack or OSISM space. Otherwise, you can use the [issues repository](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues). We appreciate PRs as well as issues; please don't forget to sign off your contributions see [contributor guide](https://docs.scs.community/community).

### Contribute and Connect

Please see the [SCS contributor guide](https://docs.scs.community/community).

### Releases and Roadmap
