# SCS-0210: k8s New Version Policy

The SCS-0210 standard outlines the expected pace at which providers should adopt new Kubernetes versions, aiming for alignment with the rapid development cycle of Kubernetes. Providers must offer the latest minor version within four months of its release and the newest patch version within a week, ensuring users have timely access to security updates, bug fixes, and features. The standard emphasizes the need for expedited updates for critical CVEs and expects providers to thoroughly test new versions before deployment.
