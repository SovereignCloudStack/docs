# SCS-0412: Metering JSON

The SCS-0412 standard addresses the need for a standardized interface to expose IaaS metering data in JSON format within the Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS). This is to aid cloud operators in integrating SCS IaaS layer data with their existing billing and customer relationship systems. The standard adopts the Ceilometer HTTP hook format provided by the OpenStack Ceilometer project for telemetry and metering, avoiding the need for additional translation layers and implementation components.
