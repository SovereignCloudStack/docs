# SCS-0300: SSO Identity Federation

The SCS-0300 standard outlines requirements for Single Sign-On (SSO) identity federation within the Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS). It addresses the need for customers to access SCS services using credentials stored and managed externally, facilitating user onboarding and reducing the need for additional dedicated SCS accounts. The standard focuses on delegating authentication to external identity providers and mapping users to roles within SCS for authorization, while also considering the use of machine identities. Keycloak is the current choice as an Identity Provider (IdP) for its support of OAuth 2.0 grants and its integration with OpenStack and kolla-ansible.
