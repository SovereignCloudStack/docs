# Getting SCS-compatible certification

The conditions to become *SCS-compatible* certified are defined in the
[SCS standard 0004](/standards/scs-0004-v1-achieving-certification).

Hints how the process is working in practice for existing certified
clouds can be found in the corresponding
[Implementation Notes](standards/scs-0004-w1-achieving-certification-implementation).

There is a [blog article with an example](https://scs.community/blog/2024/10/14/cert-adapt-example)
of running the test suite and addressing the failures. Observations on
[making an OpenStack cloud that is not using the SCS reference implementation compliant](https://scs.community/2024/05/13/cost-of-making-an-openstack-cluster-scs-compliant/)
are covered in another blog article.
