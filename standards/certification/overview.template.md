# Certification

SCS certificates come with various scopes. See [Scopes and Versions](scopes-versions.md) for details.

## Becoming certified

In order for a cloud service offering to obtain a certificate, it has to conform to all standards of the respective scope, which will be tested at regular intervals, and the results of these tests will be made available publicly. For more details on how to become certified, please consult the corresponding [document](/standards/scs-0004-v1-achieving-certification).

## Compliant cloud environments

This is a list of clouds that we test on a nightly basis against the certificate scope _SCS-compatible IaaS_.
