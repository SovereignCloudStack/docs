# Introduction

The Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) is a community-driven project that curates a set of standards—including both existing standards, such as the OpenInfra interoperability guides or the CNCF Kubernetes conformance, and newly created ones—to enable and ensure compatibility, openness, and sovereignty of cloud services across a wide range of providers, particularly small and medium businesses.

In addition, SCS provides a certification framework that enables these providers to verify and advertise their compliance with these standards. This framework consists of six kinds of certificates of varying scope, where each scope corresponds to a subset of the set of standards mentioned above.
