# SCS-0103: Standard Flavors

The SCS-0103 standard outlines mandatory and recommended specifications for flavors and properties in OpenStack environments to ensure uniformity across SCS clouds. Mandatory and recommended flavors are defined with specific configurations of vCPUs, vCPU types, RAM, and root disk sizes, alongside extra specs like scs:name-vN, scs:cpu-type, and scs:diskN-type to detail the flavor's specifications. This standard facilitates guaranteed availability and consistency of flavors, simplifying the deployment process for DevOps teams.
