# SCS-0100: Flavor Naming

The SCS Flavor Naming Standard provides a systematic approach for naming instance flavors in OpenStack environments, ensuring backward compatibility and clarity on key features like the number of vCPUs, RAM, and Root Disk, as well as extra features like GPU support and CPU generation. The standard aims for usability and portability across all SCS flavors.
