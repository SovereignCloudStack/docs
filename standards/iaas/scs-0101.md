# SCS-0101: Entropy

The SCS-0101 Entropy Standard ensures adequate entropy is available in virtual instances, crucial for operations like secure key creation in cryptography. The standard recommends using kernel version 5.18 or higher and activating the hw_rng_model: virtio attribute for images, while compute nodes should employ CPUs with entropy accessing instructions unfiltered by the hypervisor. It allows the infusion of the hosts entropy sources into virtual instances and ensures the availability and quality of entropy in virtual environments, promoting system security and efficiency.
