# SIG Community

In this meeting, we come together to shape our community strategy and coordinate collaborative efforts within our community. Our goal is to cultivate an open and welcoming community where we can share the message of SCS. We plan engaging community events, strive to make this open-source community even more inclusive, and aim to keep it informative, inspiring, and captivating. We warmly invite you to join us in our mission and become a part of this exciting journey!
