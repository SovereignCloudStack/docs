# Team IAM

The Team IAM deals with topics around Identity and Access Management.

Users that access cloud and container infrastructure need to authenticate themselves and then authorizations to see and access resources from the infrastructure are derived from the identity of the users as they belong to groups and are roles are assigned to them (or the groups they belong to).

Sovereign Cloud Stack has the goal that user identities can used across several layers in the stack (most importantly IaaS and Container layer), that user management should be a self-service capability and that user identities can be federated, i.e. user identities and authentication from one SCS cloud (or from one standards-compliant Identity Provider) can be used in other SCS clouds. Federation is an imporant principle in SCS.
