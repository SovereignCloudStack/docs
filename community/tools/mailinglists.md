# Mailing Lists

Together with [matrix](/community/tools/matrix) our mailing lists are central
to our collaboration. Currently there is this set of mailing lists:

- [SCS Community Announcements](https://scs.sovereignit.de/mailman3/postorius/lists/announce.lists.scs.community/) - This list is intended for announcements only. It is moderated. Everyone can subscribe to this list and if you want to stay in touch with SCS, you should subscribe to this list. You will be autosubscribed if you become a member of the SCS community (see below), but it's not a requirement to be a member.

- [SCS Tech Community List](https://scs.sovereignit.de/mailman3/postorius/lists/scs-tech.lists.scs.community/) - The overall list for anything related to technical discussions. Everyone can subscribe to this list. Furthermore all members of the Technology Group of the SCS Community are automatically subscribed to this list. You can subscribe also when not being a member.

- SCS Members - Members of the SCS Community are automatically subscribed to this list. Announcements and discussions regarding the SCS Community are welcome here. This list is members only.
