# Nextcloud

We have a [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com)
[instance](https://scs.sovereignit.de) for sharing files, doing polls, ...
setup for things that are not public.

You can contribute to SCS via the github workflows, asking questions there (via
opening issues against the issues repository), submitting pull requests, ...
If you want to contribute on a regular basis, we are happy to also onboard you
to the nextcloud and do an onboarding call. Nextcloud onboarding also adds you
to the `scs-member@lists.scs.community` mailing list which also add you to the
announcement list (described in the next paragraph).
