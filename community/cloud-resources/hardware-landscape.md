## Getting Started with the SCS Hardware Landscape

The SCS Hardware Landscape is a publicly accessible training and demonstration environment of the SCS reference implementation on hardware operated by the Forum SCS-Standards.
Interested parties, for example customers who want to test their software for SCS compatibility, can get access to it.
It is currently running at a colocation of ScaleUp Technologies.
