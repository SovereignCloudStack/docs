# Mission Statement

Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) offers more than just a software stack — it's the embodiment of a collaborative open-source spirit, united by the aim of achieving digital sovereignty. At the heart of this initiative is a foundational pillar: the community.

Open Source technology has become increasingly mature. However, the greatest software is useless if it cannot be developed and operated with full confidence. For this to happen, it is imperative that skills and knowledge be built up, fostered, and retained. In an increasingly competitive market for skilled people and complex IT systems, this is becoming an ever greater challenge for governments, institutions, and companies. How can we operate digital offerings in a self-determined, secure, and excellent manner?

The answer to this must be the collectivization of operational knowledge, just as it has been practiced for many years with software development.

In essence, the community is the core of the Sovereign Cloud Stack. It not only propels its evolution but also ensures its relevance, reliability, and resilience in an ever-evolving digital landscape.

## Values of our collaboration

### 4+1 Open

For us as a community, the "Four Open" are more than a philosophy; rather, we see them as fundamental values that are essential for working collaborativly.

The Four Opens give us the frame to develop SCS as a community that can be considered an important cornerstone tomorrow. We can also contribute to future developments and play an active role in shaping them.

### The 'Four Open"

- Open Source: source code - open software that can be modified without restriction, on the condition that it is not limited in functionality or performance
- Open Design: the open process for designing the software
- Open Development: the opportunity to participate in the transparent development process on an equal footing
- Open Community: an equal community where everyone can be heard

### +1 Open

For us, the 5th Open is the Open Operation. At its core, the manifesto encompasses the collective, transparent exchange of knowledge. It describes the way to encourage everyone - regardless of their level of knowledge - to contribute to the community. The 5th Open has the principle that we can only learn from mistakes and therefore has an open and friendly mistake tolerance.

Our SCS '5-Open' community is just as open as described above - join us and leave your mark on the technologies of tomorrow. Join our [Open Operations Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/open-operations-meetup/).

## Code of Conduct

### Sovereign Cloud Stack Community

Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) is a network of organizations and individuals: providers, integrators, contributors, users, developers, operators, and associates of standardized sovereign cloud infrastructure. We join forces in defining, implementing and operating a fully open, federated, compatible, interoperable cloud infrastructure and platform.

We are committed to ["The Four Opens"](https://www.openstack.org/four-opens/) of the [Open Infrastructure Foundation](https://openinfra.dev/) and align our actions according to these four non-negotiable core principles of open collaboration. To include the whole DevOps approach we added the fifth open: [Open Operations](https://openoperations.org/).

We do believe that an open and welcoming environment is essential for an active and engaged community. As contributors and maintainers we pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

No list is ever exhaustive, so we encourage members of the SCS community to adhere to the spirit, rather than the letter, of this code, as that is how it will be enforced. Places where this code may be particularly applicable are GitHub issues and pull requests, chat, mailing lists, team meetings, discussions on social networks broadly directed at or between members of the community, and other direct interactions within the community. Violations may lead to verbal or even public warnings or - especially in case of continued or flagrant offenses - may affect an individual's (or organization's) ability to participate within the SCS community.

We encourage you to confront someone or a group of people that you observe to be in violation of the CoC (whether in letter or in spirit) with your observation, so that the person(s) can correct his/her/their behavior. If this is not successful or it is difficult for you to confront the people and you seek support for this, you may contact the SCS project lead at [project-lead@lists.scs.community](project-lead@lists.scs.community)

A large fraction of SCS consists of contributions to upstream projects. All SCS contributors are expected to adhere to the respective upstream Codes of Conduct when interacting with such projects, or developing code intended for upstreaming.

### Our Standards

We ask you to please adhere to the following basic rules:

- **Be friendly and patient.** We were all new or lacked knowledge at various points in time. Please try to remember what it felt like to be on that end, and treat people accordingly.
- **Use welcoming and inclusive language.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, organization, color, immigration status, social and economic status, educational level, level of experience, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, body size and personal appearance, disability, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
- **Be helpful.** By helping others to learn our entire ecosystem is enriched. We encourage members of the SCS community to mentor each other and help to raise the general level of knowledge in the community whenever possible.
- **Choose words that shows respect, empathy and promote constructive dialogue.** We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
  - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  - Discriminatory jokes and language.
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing"), regardless of whether it is publicly available.
  - Personal insults, especially those using racist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory terms.
  - Deliberately referring to others by names or pronouns counter to their identity.
  - Unwelcome sexual attention.
  - Repeated harassment of others, e.g. not stopping behavior when someone asks you to stop.
  - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
- **Be respectful, accept differing viewpoints and focus on what is best for the community.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the SCS community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the SCS community.
- **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and SCS is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength of SCS comes from its broad community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
