## Welcome to our SCS Community

Sovereign Cloud Stack is an open community of providers and end-users joining forces in defining, implementing and operating a fully open, federated, compatible platform. We actively encourage you to contribute either code, documentation or issues and to participate in the various discussions happening on GitHub or during our various meetings.

We have created an open community space on the [Matrix network](https://matrix.to/#/#scs-community:matrix.org). Feel free to join the several channels and start interacting with the community. A good starting point is entering the [General & Announcements](https://matrix.to/#/#scs-general:matrix.org) and the [Tech channel](https://matrix.to/#/#scs-tech:matrix.org).

Check out our [Community Calendar](/community/collaboration) to know when our several Teams and SIGs meet.
