# Matrix

We have created an [open community space on the Matrix federation](https://matrix.to/#/!TiDqlLmEUaXqTemaLc:matrix.org?via=matrix.org). Feel free to join the several channels and start chatting with our community. A good starting point is entering the [General & Announcements](https://matrix.to/#/#scs-general:matrix.org) and the [Tech](https://matrix.to/#/#scs-tech:matrix.org) channel.

## Client and Registration

To connect to the Matrix federation, you will need an account on a federated homeserver and a client. The easiest way to join us is register on the popular `matrix.org` homeserver via the Element web client: <https://app.element.io/#/register>. A list of curated Matrix clients is collected on the official Matrix website: <https://matrix.org/clients/>.
